For SPY window to work you will have to get your demo api keys on https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview -> API Keys, and put them into config.json.
Currently there are some random keys that will produce errors if more than one person is connected:
("key": "PKQE2J4W14D1HUDBD4LO",
"secret": "5cD3hvRKaiSppJdYjY5MOjNUbXj08IoNFgEslBJt")
